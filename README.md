# Sparse Matrix Operations

This project implements sparse matrix operations (addition, subtraction, and multiplication) in Python. The matrices are stored in a memory-efficient format, and the program handles large input files.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `dsa/sparse_matrix/code/src/` directory.
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
